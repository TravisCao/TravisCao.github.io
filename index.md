<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio.</h2>

I am currently pursuing a PhD degree at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk). I'm very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Yue Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/academicyuechen/home). Prior to this, I earned my Master's degree and Bachelor's degree in [CUHK-Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn), where I collaborated with [Prof. Junhua Zhao](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/zhaojunhua).

Currently, I work at the nexus of smart grid technology, AI, and optimization techniques.
